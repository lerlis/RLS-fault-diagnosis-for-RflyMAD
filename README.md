This an example of fault diagnosis method by using RflyMAD dataset.

The method used here is a RLS-based method by Azarakhsh Keipour, and the paper could be seen at
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8794286?arnumber=8794286
and
https://theairlab.org/fault-detection/

The users who want to run this code needs a MATLAB workspace,
by writing the name of data in the variable of 'name' in 'load_manipulate_data.m' and then run the 'rls.m', you could get your result!

Attention:

You need to run 'ulog2csv' in each folder contains the ULog data to get the converted CSV files.
